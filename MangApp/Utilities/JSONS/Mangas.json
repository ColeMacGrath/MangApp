Much to Ryo's confusion, Dee takes an immediate interest in his new partner.\n\nIn their first case together, Ryo and Dee must take care of Bikky—a young boy whose father was killed due to his involvement in a shady drug trafficking business. Bikky denies having any knowledge about his father's actions prior to his murder. Even so, it is up to Ryo and Dee to protect the boy from those wanting to get rid of him and preserve any evidence he might be holding back.\n\nAs time goes on and the detective duo works increasingly more together, the distance between them gradually shortens.

Mikan naively believes that her aloof best friend would always be by her side until Hotaru decides to depart for Tokyo to attend Alice Academy. The school is home to gifted children who possess unique abilities known as \"Alices.\" Heartbroken and feeling abandoned, Mikan runs away from home in pursuit of her friend, hoping that she too can enroll in the prestigious institution.\n\nAs Mikan gets accepted as a student at Alice Academy and reunites with her friend, she quickly learns that the academy is not all fun and games. The school itself is divided into a hierarchy system based on the strength of their Alice, behavior, and academic performance, as well as classifying each student under a specific Alice subgroup for a more personalized education. When she finds herself in the lowest rank, Mikan faces bullying from her classmates who all believe that she does not belong. Natsume Hyuuga, one of the academy's highest ranking students, is especially vitriolic towards Mikan for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe students begin to discover that the special academy has hidden secrets—many of which are a lot darker than one might think. As they unravel these mysteries, Mikan and her friends find themselves entangled in something far bigger than they could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mani is convinced that there is something very odd about her family and the other members of the community. She might be right. \"The Laidback Person I Will Never Forget\" is a short piece in which a young woman named Yukari begins to doubt her relationship with Takafumi, her slacker / surfer boyfriend. She loves him but she's beginning to think that he might be a bit too laid back for his own good and that their relationship might not have much of a future. \"Club Hurricane\" (split into four sections and comprising by far the largest portion of the volume) is the tale of Andrew and Rose - twins who find themselves sent off to an odd, remote boarding school in the country as a result of their parents' divorce. Once there, the siblings have to deal with isolation, rejection, their eccentric new schoolmates and their reliance on one another. (Source: ANN)",

Haunted by his rejection of her feelings toward him, she spends that night binging soda at her mother's cafe. Despite her efforts to get over him, she sheds a tear that drops into her cup, changing the soda into a seven-colored drink.\n\nAfter chugging the drink, Mayu suddenly meets a self-proclaimed \"drink fairy\" named Pucho, who rages at her for drinking what was supposed to be for herself. Due to Pucho's drink, Mayu now transforms whenever she drinks something—which often results in disastrous effects! Both Mayu and Pucho are now endlessly distressed... until Pucho sees that Mayu may still have feelings for Shinya.\n\nTo make Pucho's seven-colored pixie pop, a human tear needs to be mixed with seven-colored drops that are gained from feelings of love. The two girls take this as an opportunity for Mayu to try again and win over Shinya, but with Shinya being difficult and Mayu's unpredictable transformations, their quest will not be easy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His favorite thing to do is sleep - which doesn't exactly endear him to his teachers when he dozes off in class. Whenever he falls asleep, Naoto dreams of the same fantasy world. Then one day, Naoto gets magically summoned into the very world he had once only seen in dreams! All at once, he's caught up in a battle between the powerful beings called Elphis, and a group of human-like beings called the Sand Dusts. For Naoto, this desert world of Orgos is no longer a dream-he can feel pain here, and possibly even die. He decides he'd rather not risk his life, and would like nothing more than to return home. But the pretty sorceress who summoned him in the first place has other plans for him.\n\n(Source: ADV)",

Even though he has known her since elementary school, all of a sudden, ever since she came back from summer vacation, he has been crushing on her...hard.\n\nBut something is different about Kurara—she's acting very oddly. Sometimes she seems wholesome, pure, and innocent, and at other times she is extremely forward and unabashed. Kouhei soon learns that Kurara has multiple personalities—and decides to help her keep her secret from their classmates. But Kouhei finds himself struggling between helping Kurara as a friend and trying to win her heart... which is a challenge, since she has many!

But even as Cagalli and Athrun visit Chairman Durandal to cement the tentative cease-fire, Zaft terrorists plot with Neo Roanoke to drag both sides into all-out war. The plan: storm Zaft territory and steal several Gundam Mobile Suits. But that's only the beginning.

Now the crew of the Minerva must prevent disaster, as everything and everyone-including the love between Athrun and Cagalli-is thrown in mortal danger.\n\n(Source: Del Rey)\n",

            "sypnosis": "There is said to be a legendary \"Ghost of Akina\" that holds the fastest time to descend the Akina Pass. No one has ever come close to beating the record, nor has the mysterious driver of the white Toyota AE86 ever revealed themselves. Nowadays, the same AE86 can be seen every morning driving up and down the pass, making trips to a hotel residing at the top of the mountain.\n\nUnlike his classmates and coworkers, Takumi Fujiwara did not like cars. Any conversation about them would remind him of his early morning routine of delivering tofu for his father. He did not see the appeal in street racing and knew nothing about its rules or its culture. However, when tagging along to a nighttime meetup, the appearance of a rival racing team at the Akina Pass compels Takumi to hop behind the wheel of his father's AE86 and race them down the familiar mountain.\n\nThis spur-of-the-moment decision marks the beginning of Takumi's high-octane journey, shifting from his daily deliveries to becoming the greatest drift racer ever. Along the way, he slowly finds and kindles his love for street racing as he comes face-to-face with a plethora of opponents, each ready to take on the renowned Ghost of Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "sypnosis": "Unlike her family, Karin Maaka is a vampire who walks outside during the day and sleeps during the night. Nobody from her town knows of her true identity—and she plans to keep it that way, as it could jeopardize her \"normal\" life if someone were to find out.\n\nKenta Usui witnesses Karin bite someone on the day he transfers into her class as a new student. Thinking that something provocative is happening, Kenta tries talking to Karin, only to bring about a series of misunderstandings. After Karin begins avoiding Kenta, he becomes determined to set things straight between them. However, the moment he gets close to her, she has a massive nosebleed!\n\nThis is Karin's true secret—rather than sucking it out of humans, she periodically produces excessive amounts of blood, leading to nosebleeds if she does not release it. Unfortunately, her blood seems to react strangely to Kenta. Armed with knowledge of Karin's truth, will Kenta be able to keep her secret?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At first glance, most may overlook the filthy boy in his ragged coat with the bird on his shoulder. But when their cherished possessions are taken away, Jing will also steal their attention, opening their eyes to the true intent of the figure they once blindly thought to fear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shinichi Izumi is a 16-year-old high school student who lives with his parents in a quiet neighborhood. One night, a Parasite invades Shinichi's body in an attempt to take control of it. However, it fails to complete the takeover process and ultimately ends up inhabiting only his right arm. \n\nThus, both Shinichi and the Parasite—who calls himself Migi—retain their individual minds. Now in a peculiar \"human and alien\" relationship, Migi proposes that they cooperate to survive. Shinichi has no choice but to agree, and he must now cling to his morality as he and Migi face off against other bloodthirsty Parasites.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the results of the entrance exams came out, it turns out that Ayumu herself passed, but unfortunately, Shinozuka did not. Consequently, Shinozuka reveals everything she had felt about Ayumu—nothing but resentment.\n\nDepressed that her closest friend has now deserted her, Ayumu finds a way to make her temporarily forget the loneliness: self-injury. As a result, she chooses to be alone and quickly becomes an outcast at her new school, refusing to socialize with anyone. Yet when her classmate Manami Anzai suddenly befriends her, Ayumu's world seems to brighten—but little does she know that something more horrible would start coming her way.\n\nLife is the story of a certain girl's isolation, a tale filled with despair and persecution enough to bring any person to the brink of insanity. However, only the strongest will find the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how impossible the odds may seem.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She hopes to find the boy she calls the \"Flan Prince\"—a boy who touched her heart with a cup of flan seven years ago. Now 13 years old, Najika finds that the spoon that he left behind with the flan shares its emblem with the school she has been accepted to—the prestigious Seika Academy.\n\nWith high hopes, Najika enters her school's beautiful campus and becomes a first-year student in Seika's junior high division. While unpopular with her fellow classmates due to her love of eating, she seems to find support from two boys who recognize her culinary talents—the popular brothers Daichi and Sora Kitazawa. Will Najika be able to find her place in the academy with her cooking, and perhaps also reunite with her Flan Prince?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Introducing himself as a long time admirer that had finally found the resolve to confess his feelings, Hoshino declares that everything will work out between the two as long as he remains unabashedly honest with her. After denying Hoshino's sudden request for a date, Negishi, bewildered but intrigued with Hoshino's candidness, agrees to walk home with him.\n\nThus begins the romantic comedy Love Roma, which follows the progressing relationship between Hoshino, who says whatever is on his mind with absolutely no reserve, and Negishi, playing the straight man to the boy's comic persistence of his feelings toward her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

In the midst of complaining to her friends, two attractive boys fall out of the sky right in front of her. They introduce themselves as Zero and Ichii—two candidates who are taking a magical exam to become professional wizards. As part of the test, the duo is tasked with finding the \"Crystal Pearl\" and protecting it for six months from the other applicants. After the examination period, the pair that possess the pearl will automatically become full-fledged wizards.\n\nWhen the two discover that Nina had accidentally mistaken it for candy and swallowed it, the boys have no choice but to act as her full-time bodyguards for the rest of the exam until an antidote to remove the pearl can be created. Safeguarding a human from their crazy wizard candidate foes is a lot more challenging and exhausting than Zero and Ichii realize. Will they be able to pass the exam while protecting Nina's life?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Medical Magical\nVolume 2: Kaitou Papillon"

As much as he wants to return to Europe, his phobia of flying traps him in Japan where he now lives.\n\nOne night, he passes out, and ends up being taken in by Megumi \"Nodame\" Noda. Upon first glance, Nodame is a talented pianist, but she is also slobbish and eccentric. What's even worse is that she is his neighbor and he ends up forced to work with her. Though it sounds like a recipe for disaster, Chiaki is drawn to this girl who makes him remember the love for music he once held. Just what does the future hold for this musical duo?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

However, she now hides her passion six days a week, afraid that she will be ridiculed by her peers or her overly strict father. Only on Sundays can she freely express herself among like-minded teens in Harajuku.\n\nEven without disclosing her secret hobbies, Yaya is treated poorly by Seri and Moe, two mean girls who she calls friends. As hard as she tries to remain optimistic, Yaya is painfully aware that no one at school speaks to her besides her bullies and an almost offensively straightforward male classmate named Moriyama.\n\nWhen a fierce, no-nonsense girl named Nana starts taking care of Yaya's troubles—paying back Seri and Moe for their cruel pranks and kicking down predatory men who approach Yaya in the street—it seems too good to be true. Moriyama encounters Nana more than once, and as he sees Yaya in class every day, he gradually begins to suspect that these two vastly different girls are the same person!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Having been invited by his aunt to stay rent-free at her housing complex, he unhesitatingly accepts her offer. But unbeknownst to him, the boarding house is actually an all-girls dormitory.\n\nUpon visiting his new school, Yamato catches sight of a girl training for the high jump. Amazed by her athletic ability and beauty, he yearns to learn more about her. To his fortune, this girl, Suzuka Asahina, lives right next door to him—but all of their encounters thus far has given Suzuka a bad impression of him. In spite of the constant misunderstandings, Yamato still joins the track team with the intent of impressing her and soon discovers he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter sprinter. With friendship, and possibly love on the line, Yamato trains his heart out in order to win over the girl he loves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

Fortunately, Lupin tends to avoid robbing society's virtuous and, instead, targets some pretty shady characters.\n\nOf course, he partners with some pretty shady characters as well: Daisuke Jigen is an ex-mafia hit man who carries himself with a somber demeanor, his trademark black fedora tilted forward to hide his eyes. Goemon Ishikawa is a cipher-like swordsman with samurai-ish overtones who mysteriously fades in and out of Lupin's exploits. Fujiko Mine is the object of Lupin's affections, but, since she is a thief herself, the duo's romance more than occasionally clashes with their competition for big scores.\n\nThe global police force, Interpol, and in particular the tenacious Inspector Zenigata, long to capture Lupin and his gang. Zenigata's relationship with the eponymous master thief is a complicated one, characterized by mutual respect laced with utter disdain. The two have even worked together when it's served both their interests, but they understand that when the crisis ends, they must resume their former wariness and animosity toward each other.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)"

Of course, then he just happens to find out the school he choose is under frequent attack by strange creatures called ''Orphans'', and the school set up a special task force of female members called ''HiME''s, using various elements as their powers, to battle these invaders. That's not all, though. Each member of the HiME task force has their own, unique ''Key'', another person whom, upon being discovered, can team up with the HiME to create a ''Child'', a combative unit specifically needed to effectively battle these Orphans. And with Yuuichi's luck, he just happens to find out he's not just the ''Key'' for one of the HiMEs, but for two... Two highly competitive, rival schoolgirls. And that's only the start of the trouble. \n\n(Source: Tokyopop)"

Little does she know that Rei finds one of her sketches on the back of the map and becomes captivated by her artistic skills.\n\nMuch to Kira's chagrin, Rei immediately recognizes her at school, but she ignores his attempts at striking up a conversation. However, Rei's sincere praise about her drawing leads Kira to see the violent rebel in a better light. After watching him kiss a statue of the god Mars, Kira feels so moved that she instantly requests him to model for her.\n\nAs Kira and Rei's chance encounter begins to develop into a flourishing relationship, what is to become of these two polar personalities?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

You see, he inadvertently reaches the Goddess Technical Help Line, and a goddess is dispatched to grant him one wish.\n\nThe lovely young Belldandy informs him that he may have one wish - a wish for virtually anything in the world. In disbelief, Keiichi opts for a wish he believes will confound the system (and will prove that Belldandy has no particular wish-granting power): he wishes that Belldandy would stay with him always.\n\nThe power of this wish almost rips the fabric of time and space but it is ultimately granted. But of course such a wish has unforseen consequences, including the fact that Keiichi lives in a guys-only dorm. When his roommates return to find him with a woman on the premises, he is immediately tossed out on to the street. But the wish also has other unexpected side effects - such as when Keiichi and Belldandy are in peril of being separated, a motorcycle is suddenly repaired so that they can travel together.\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)"

Meanwhile, an angel is attempting to seal the queen of the underworld into a holy ball with his bow. Unfortunately, he misfires, trapping her instead inside of Kouta's unwitting balls. The angel departs, leaving Kouta a dire warning: if he fails to resist ejaculating before the end of the month, the queen will be released and mark the end of the world.\n\nFor the lustful Kouta, such a commitment is easier said than done; on top of using any means necessary to resist temptation, he must also guard himself from advances made by Elyse, a lesser devil who would resort to drastic measures to free her queen. In Oretama, the fate of the entire world rests upon the improbability of one man's chastity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: There are five specials: Extra Ball 1-3 and Special Ball 1 & 2 are coupled with the tankoubon releases."

However, Tatsuhiro soon realizes that socializing may be too far-fetched a dream for him, as he struggles to get through even the most basic interactions with others. With the help of the mysterious Misaki Nakahara, who claims she can cure him of his current lifestyle, will he be able to turn his life around?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For Jing, the King of Bandits, all he has to his name are fear-mongering rumors that have spread between the cracks of civilization. Despite his infamy, he, along with his partner in crime and incurable womanizer Kir, roams the recesses of the world. Those who witness the pair with anxious hearts and minds cower at the thought of becoming Jing's next target.\n\nBut with every grand heist, it is not just mere precious treasures Jing is seeking to pry from his unwitting victims. Their undivided attention is just as valuable, showing how they ruin themselves over their foolishly prized possessions. Jing knows there is no better way to make his demands than through awe-inspiring fear—fear of the King of Bandits.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When her father suddenly gets transferred to another part of the country, Kyou gets the opportunity to attend Seisyu Academy. She is excited because Seisyu is famous for its cute girls' uniforms. When she opens the box sent by the school, however, Kyou discovers an unflattering boys' uniform instead!\n\nAs it turns out, her father has faked paperwork and enrolled her as a male student so she can join the school basketball team, which is ranked fourth in Japan. As a sacrifice to carry on her father's legacy, Kyou begrudgingly cuts her hair and moves into the boys' dormitory. She meets her roommate and teammate Chiharu Eniwa but somehow manages to irritate him on the very first day. He is quick to taunt Kyou about her short stature and questions her dedication to the sport. Will Kyou be able to live in close quarters with someone so annoying and thrive on the basketball team, all while hiding her true gender from everyone?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She is both aided and limited by 'S's' vague (but kind) guardian, Sovieul, who is the cause for Sekai's presence in 17th century France. Sovieul vows to protect Sekai, but offers little information as to why these strange events are happening.\n\nUnfortunately, they encounter Machiavello (also referred to as the Devil) who looks a lot like Sekai's childhood friend and love Midou. Machiavello covets the powers shared by Sekai and 'S' so he may obtain the power of the Devil R. Sekai only wants to find Midou and return to her time, but she's constantly hindered by her conflicting desires with 'S' and by Machiavello's attempts to obtain her body. To find Midou, Sekai must cooperate with 'S' and Sovieul to traverse through time while avoiding Machiavello. (Source: Tokyopop)",

This infamous enemy of the law is the secret identity of Meimi Haneoka, a 14-year-old student attending Saint Paulia's Private School. With the help of her nun-in-training friend, Seira Mimori, Meimi assumes her alter ego during the night to help those in need.\n\nWhile her heists usually go through without a hitch, things begin to change when a certain boy starts showing up during her ventures—enter Daiki Asuka, who is known as \"Asuka Jr.\" due to sharing his name with his father, a well-known local detective. Not only does he voice his resolve to be the one to capture Saint Tail, but he is also Meimi's classmate at school! After the young detective's first nocturnal encounter with the now-wary magician thief, a cat-and-mouse chase begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, following the breach of a taboo in an attempt to revive the villainous youkai Gyuumaou, the \"Minus Wave\" unleashes throughout the land. With this ghastly force at large, the youkai begin to lose their self-consciousness, causing them to devour the townspeople.\n\nTasked by the Three Aspects—the messengers of the heavens—to stop Gyuumaou's resurrection and restore peace, Sanzou Genjou rounds up three old comrades, none of which resemble the definition of ordinary. Being half-human, Gokuu Son, Hakkai Cho, and Gojou Sha are the only youkai with the power and spirituality to withstand the Minus Wave. Despite being skeptical about trusting them due to their mixed blood, Sanzou heads to the west with his companions to eradicate the growing threat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These mutated humans became known as Alters and were responsible for turning the former Yokohama into a chaotic wasteland.\n\nNow, as the former metropolis continues to re-build itself, the Alters have fallen into two camps: those who have joined HOLY, a dogmatic organization that hopes to re-establish order and morality, and those who wish to lord over the comparatively weaker humans. Only Kazuma, a powerful Alter who's really only interested in looking out for himself and an orphan girl named Kanami, stands between them, suspicious of both sides and unaware that he may hold the key to harmonious co-existence.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

With each embalming, Shinjuurou brings the inner beauty of the deceased back to life to give their loved ones a chance to properly say goodbye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although the pair shares a four-year age difference, they find themselves quickly falling for each other even as Akira finds himself being increasingly more involved with thefts, some of which include Utako's family. This as well as several other obstacles give the young couple's budding relationship a fair amount of difficulty.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The war between humans (Terran) and vampires (Methuselah) continues, as a struggle between two factions: the Vatican and the New Human Empire.\n\nYet, amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species. However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group \"AX,\" led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have—even a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

One day, while waiting to take the subway to school, Kei's classmate Masaru Katou leaps onto the tracks in an effort to save a drunk man. Driven by an uncharacteristic desire to rescue someone else, Kei follows Katou down into danger. While successful in saving him, the two boys are killed by the train.\n\nKei wakes up beside Katou in an apartment full of strangers and furnished by a giant black orb with a glass-like outer surface. After finding out that everyone in the room has recently died, words appear on the black ball tasking them with killing a strange creature. The ball equips Kei and the others with power suits and mysterious guns before sending them off to collect this bizarre bounty.\n\nAlthough Kei discovers the mission to be far more deadly than originally suspected, he manages to survive. He is teleported back to the apartment where he and the other survivors are rewarded point values according to their actions in battle by the black sphere, which a fellow survivor says is called \"Gantz.\" Despite his death earlier that day, Kei is granted the ability to return to his daily life with one condition: he can be uprooted from his day at any time and summoned back to the apartment, where Gantz will task him and other recently deceased with the assassination of another target. \n\nWhile Katou dreads the inevitable return to Gantz, Kei finds himself living for the sole purpose of carrying out these missions. Thriving in the heat of battle and learning to care about himself and his comrades, Kei faces escalating monstrous threats that begin to bleed out into his normal life outside of Gantz.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shima is a smart kid with a knack for solving other people's problems. He's recently lost his parents to an arson's fire. Now the sight of fire makes him cringe, often reducing the super sleuth into a pool of tears.\n\nKaori, a supermodel, seems an unlikely partner for Shima, but they've been best friends since Kaori hired the junior Sherlock to rid him of a troublesome stalker. For some reason, Shima is comfortable mourning in front of the handsome Kaori; on his end, Kaori trusts Shima to help him suppress his over-aggressive modeling persona, Kyo.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

Spoken in fearful whispers, the word \"Yoma\" cuts a clear image into the minds of all: monstrous beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. But fear of their gruesome appetite is dwarfed by that of their ability to shapeshift and steal the memories of their last meal. Forever vulnerable to attack, humans live in unease, even among family.\n\nThere are few means to kill a Yoma. The Organization, informally known as \"Claymore,\" is humanity's only line of defense, dispatching half-human, half-Yoma female warriors to purify villages of Yoma. A lonely and dangerous existence, death for these warriors comes with each new assignment. What time is found between trying battles and long, arduous travels is spent in ever-intensifying struggle to resist their Yoma blood and maintain their humanity. Villagers, knowing of this, pay for their security reluctantly and have only loathsome regard for their protectors.\n\nClaymore follows the stoic and low-ranking member Clare in her daunting trek as she searches for personal vengeance. Along the way, she encounters many unexpected things about the world, from the camaraderie and hope held fast by her sisters-in-arms to the sinister truth behind the Claymore Organization.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Under the command of their respective guild masters, these guilds are made up of witches and wizards who take on various job requests to earn fame and fortune. One particular guild stands high above the rest in both strength and spirit, and its name is Fairy Tail.\n\nIn his quest to find his dragon foster father—Igneel—Natsu Dragneel, a fiery and reckless mage, and his partner Happy run into a young celestial mage by the name of Lucy Heartfilia, who reveals that it's her dream to become a full-fledged wizard and join the Fairy Tail guild. After rescuing her from an abduction attempt, Natsu offers her a home in Fairy Tail. Now a member of the guild, Lucy teams up with Natsu and befriends fellow wizards Gray Fullbuster and Erza \"Titania\" Scarlet. Together, this motley crew set out on their many adventures, gaining many faithful allies and deadly foes along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fleeing from the attack on her home, Faana and her companions hide in the woods, hoping to escape from the Granza Military. However, as her group is hunted down, Faana is the only one fortunate enough to escape alive. Half-dead, she somehow manages to travel several kilometers to the Kingdom of Cordeaa, where she passes out in a lake. Upon awakening 3 days later, she is surprised to find herself inside the castle of King Yogufu, the ruler of Cordeaa. Faana is even more surprised though, when she meets his daughter, Princess Orfina--the two girls are identical strangers. The two become fast friends, but this period of happiness doesn't last long as Granza soon advances it's power into Cordeaa...\n\n(Source: TJO)"

But the universe is just cruelly, irredeemably, monstrously unfair, so instead she found herself thrown out of home, stuck in an all-boys boarding school with a roommate she hates, cursed with a hideous haircut and wearing clothes which, to be frank, she wouldn't be seen dead in.\n\nAnd the only thing worse than her current situation is the one that she'll be in if anyone ever realizes that she is, in fact, a girl. Everything is wrong! Everything! Particularly the fact that, even though she's surrounded by amazingly gorgeous guys, her chances of romance are less than zero. But with life this complicated, something is bound to give. In fact, it just did. Damn.\n\n(Source: Storm in Heaven)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Nopan Musume.

Inside one of the rooms is a large mirror with a small crack rumored to harbor a ghost. Despite the rumors, Ichika goes to clean it—only to see some other figure in place of her own reflection! When she returns to the room to search for her cell phone, Ichika finds the figure outside of the mirror—a girl, with ponytails and a flowy dress, named Manatsu Kuroki. \n\nUpon getting her cell phone back, one of the stones on Ichika's cell phone charm begins to shine, changing her outfit and allowing her to fly toward a being known as a Djinn. Ichika is then tasked to do Manatsu's homework assignment for her—to use the cell phone charm throughout the summer and write down her experiences with the Djinn she summons. Unbeknownst to her, Ichika's encounter with Manatsu will be the start of a summer she will never forget.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
